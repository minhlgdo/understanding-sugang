# Understanding SNU Sugang
 
## Purpose
As an international student studying in Seoul National University (SNU), I have always been asked by prospective students how many percentage of classes conducted in English. Most of the time, I feel pity that I cannot give them an exact number. At the same time, I know that there are not many choices for the minority like us to choose what classes we can take, but I never thought, or questioned about the amount of English classes provided in SNU. 

That is why I started this small research project. For current students, the research project will help them have a better understanding of their major and their department. For prospective students, or any candidates who are interested in applying to our university, I hope the project serves as a good reference to decide whether SNU is worthy enough and whether their Korean proficiency is enough to survive in an extremely competitive enviroment like SNU or not. I don't want to scare anyone out, but in the end, SNU is still a Korean national university. If you want to thrive in this environment, especially if you are undergraduate student, you have to ace Korean language. 

For now, I only do research about the current semester (2021, 2nd semester). In the future, I would like to work with data from the previous semester, as well as for previous years to fully visualize the academic environment in SNU.
